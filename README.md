## Description

In this liveProject you’ll step into the shoes of a backend engineer working for a SaaS company that builds custom WhatsApp messaging tools. Your new client is a college professor who wants to be able to send group messages to her students. Your challenge is creating cloud-based software that lets your client write customizable messages, send messages to individuals or an uploaded group list, and view a message delivery status log. To do this, you’ll use Node.JS, a serverless framework, and AWS resources such as Lambda Function and DynamoDB.
